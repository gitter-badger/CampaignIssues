# Campaign Issues

We can be certain that other issues will emerge, but as of right now we would expect that these are the major issues for the 2018 Jake Porter For Iowa Governor Campaign.

#How YOU can use this repository.

**This repository is a resource for Jake Porter volunteers who use social media and traditional media. 

It includes a [Bulk Hootsuite Template .CSV file](https://github.com/jakeporter/CampaignIssues/blob/master/BulkHootsuiteTemplate.CSV)** which can be used with Hootsuite to accomplish bulk uploads of tweets about Jake Porter's positions on the issues.

A.csv file is a file of Comma-Separated Values ... very easy to use in text editors or spreadsheets, but remember to be careful about using commas anywhere.  

These particular colomns were chosen because they comply with the format for [bulk uploading robo-tweets to Hootsuite](http://blog.hootsuite.com/how-to-bulk-schedule/) for easily publicizing lists of events on Twitter.  Hootsuite happens to be very particular about case, so make sure you use .csv as a file extension, not .CSV. 

**Column 1:** Date and time that the robo-Tweet will be sent by Hootsuite. The accepted DATE format is: mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm

**Column 2**: The desciption of the event. Twitter messages are 140 characters including the URL (which takes another 23 characters), so the max length for the description is 117 char, but it is best to keep it much shorter, so that people can RT and reply.

**Column 3**: The full URL of the event or listing of events; regardless of how long this URL is, it will be shortened to an 23-char tiny URL by Hootsuite or Twitter.

These are the three columns are that Hootsuite uses for bulk upload robo-tweets, but the CSV files can easily be sorted, parsed, manipulated by those who find them useful.
  

**This repository also includes templates for traditional media** such as Letters to the Editor, emails to news directors at local radio/TV stations and other ways of sharing your support for Jake Porter's candidacy.
